<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>🤔 As a university student, I want to quickly access a list of searched courses and easily save items to a shopping cart so that I can return to see different course schedules and consider enrolling in the suitable one later. Additionally, when searching for courses, students benefit from the reviews and feedback of prior students on their prospective classes.</p>
