<h2>Inspiration</h2>
As a university student, I want to quickly access a list of the searched courses and easily save items to a shopping
cart, so that I can return to see different course schedule and consider enrolling the suitable one later. Also, when searching courses, students need the help of prior students' reviews in decision making. 

<h2>What does it do</h2>
Enroll 101 saves your time when you want to add the course to shopping cart. Whether you're new to campus or a senior about to graduate, whether you are on a phone or desktop, Enroll 101 provides an environment for students navigate through different subjects during the course registration. 

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
Team work? Try to set the tone of the website consistent?

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
Created a platform to connect students with one another with features like app notifications on your tab, leave conversation, reveal identity, well-designed chat box. In addition, we created logos and designs to add some dynamism to our front page.
