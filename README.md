<h2>Inspiration</h2>
As a university student, I want to quickly access a list of the searched courses and easily save items to a shopping
cart, so that I can return to see different course schedule and consider enrolling the suitable one later. Also, when searching courses, students benefit from the reviews and feedback of prior students' on their prospective classes. Our website is designed to streamline and improve course registration for university students. 

<h2>What does it do</h2>
Enroll 101 saves your time when you want to add the course to shopping cart compared to other registration sites (Connect Carolina). Our site is optimized for phone and desktop. Whether you're new to campus or a senior about to graduate, Enroll 101 provides an environment for students navigate through different subjects during the course registration.
