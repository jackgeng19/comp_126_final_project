	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<p>As a university student, I want to quickly access a list of the searched courses and easily save items to a shopping cart, so that I can return to see different course schedule and consider enrolling the suitable one later. Also, when searching courses, students benefit from the reviews and feedback of prior students' on their prospective classes. Our website is designed to streamline and improve course registration for university students. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
	<h2>What does it do?</h2>

Whether you're new to campus or a senior about to graduate, Enroll 101 provides an environment for students navigate through different subjects during the course registration. ðŸš€</p>
